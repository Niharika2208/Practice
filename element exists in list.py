Check if element exists in list in Python
There are two methods that I could think of!
"""

# array = [9, 4, 8, 1, 0, 3]
# element = 2
#
# if element in array:
#     print(element, "exists")
# else:
#     print(element, "Doesn't exist")


array = [9, 4, 8, 1, 0, 3]
for i in array:
    if i == 2:
        print("Exists")
